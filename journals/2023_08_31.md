- User-friendly data input forms were created and used in order to collect the data using QField application. We also used offline editing tools in order to collect the data in the field if there was no internet connection, Especially here in South Africa where there is no internet when there is load shedding.

- Analytical models were used to derive insights from the data. These models allowed us to look at the relationship the spatial data has in relation to each other so that an easy-to-understand solution can be found.
