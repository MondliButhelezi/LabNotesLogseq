		- QGIS Road to Nerdvana Episode 15: Making a small scale map of Africa:
		- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJIiZfA7Iio&ab_channel=Kartoza}}
		- Modules 3, 5 and 6 (Symbology, Labelling and Composer)
		- Used these map projection co-ordinates to sort the minimap projection and created a custom projection.
		  
		  ``` Map Projection
		  +proj=ortho +lat_0=0.19 +lon_0=21.96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +R=6371000 +units=m +no_defs
		  This should be added as a new Custom CRS in your project settings
		  
		  ``` srs

		- ### Notes from Intern Hang:
			- Keep lab notes for every exercise we get, specifically focussing on steps followed, resources used and corrections made.
			- Make sure you always fork and only do a pull request on the upstream folder, the push request is on your forked repo, not the original.
			- Cool extensions to have: Github pull request, Markdown All in One, Spell check
