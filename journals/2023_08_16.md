# Django App Views and Templates Assignment
- ## Assignment Overview
- ### Page Structure
- Create views and templates for your Django app with the following page structure:
  
  1. **Website Index Page (127.0.0.1:8000/):**
	- This page serves as the website's index page.
	- It contains links to the first model page, second model page, and the admin page.
	  
	  2. **First Model Index Page (127.0.0.1:8000/<first_model>):**
	- This page displays a list of records for the first model in a tabular format.
	- Each record is accompanied by edit and delete buttons (can be text links).
	- A link to add a new record should also be present.
	  
	  3. **Second Model Index Page (127.0.0.1:8000/<second_model>):**
	- Similar to the first model's index page, this page displays records for the second model.
- ### Custom 404 Error Page
- Implement a custom 404 error page that displays when a user enters a non-existent URL.
- For example, if a user goes to 127.0.0.1:8000/<first_model>/100 but there's no record with ID 100 for the first model, the custom 404 error page should appear instead of Django's default 404 page.
- ### Model Selection
- Choose the models for the first and second model index pages from your previously created models.
- If possible, select models without a geometry field, as geometry field forms haven't been covered yet. However, you can choose to work with models containing a geometry field if you're up for a challenge.
- If you only have one model without a geometry field, consider creating a new model that fits the assignment's requirements. The model should be based on your Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- ## Notes
- Ensure that you create appropriate views and templates for each page following the given structure.
- Implement the necessary URL routing to link these views with the correct URLs.
- Utilize the Django admin page for administrative tasks.
