- ## Week Three
	- ### Logseq Git Setup
		- Update version control
		- Set up git hub version control
		- I used GitBash and GitHub to setup my logseq to always commit remotely to a GitHub repo. This is how I did it.

		- Implementing the Data Model by creating a table and databases

		- ```
		  create table people (id serial not null primary key,
		                       name varchar(50),
		                       house_no int not null,

	- ## Chapter 16
		- ### Configuring Databases to use PostGIS
			- Installing PostGIS and linking it to QGIS as previously stated on the 16th of May on the Journal
			- Adding Simple Feature Model and add a constraint based on geometry type
			- ```
			  alter table people
			  add constraint people_geom_point_chk
			      check(st_geometrytype(the_geom) = 'ST_Point'::text
			            OR the_geom IS NULL);
			            
			  create table cities (id serial not null primary key,
			                       name varchar(50),
			                       the_geom geometry not null);
			   alter table cities
			   add constraint cities_geom_point_chk
			   check (st_geometrytype(the_geom) = 'ST_Polygon'::text );
			   		
			  ```
			- #### Import and Export data in PostGIS.
				- shp2pgsql, pgsql2shp and ogr2ogr
				- ```
				  pgsql2shp -f <path to new shapefile> -g <geometry column name> \
				    -h <hostname> -U <username> <databasename> <table | view>
				    
				    pgsql2shp -f <path to new shapefile> -g <geometry column name> \
				    -h <hostname> -U <username> "<query>"
				    
				    ogr2ogr -f GML export.gml PG:'dbname=<databasename> user=<username>
				          host=<hostname>' <Name of PostGIS-Table>
				  ```
