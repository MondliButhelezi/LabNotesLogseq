- # Updating Django App to Use Class-Based Views
- ## Objectives
- Refactor the Django app to utilize Class-Based Views (CBVs) for improved code organization and reusability.
- Implement functions for CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records.
- Establish shared fields across models using a base class, incorporating fields like `last_update`, `last_update_by`, etc.
- Automate the updating of `last_update` and similar fields whenever a record is saved.
- Set the `last_update` field and other relevant fields as read-only in the form, allowing users to view values but not update them.
- ## Steps
- ### 1. Refactor to Class-Based Views (CBVs)
- Update your views to use Django's CBVs for a more structured approach.
- Extend appropriate CBV classes like `CreateView`, `DetailView`, `UpdateView`, and `DeleteView` for each operation.
- ### 2. CRUD Functionality
- Implement methods within the CBVs to handle CRUD operations:
	- `CreateView`: Implement `form_valid()` to save a new record upon form submission.
	- `DetailView`: Fetch and display the details of a record.
	- `UpdateView`: Implement `form_valid()` to update an existing record.
	- `DeleteView`: Delete a record upon user confirmation.
- ### 3. Shared Fields and Base Class
- Create a base model class that includes shared fields such as `last_update`, `last_update_by`, etc.
- Define your application-specific models by inheriting from this base class.
- This inheritance mechanism ensures consistent shared field implementation across models.
- ### 4. Automatic Updating of Fields
- Override the model's `save()` method to automatically update fields like `last_update` whenever a record is saved.
- Utilize the `timezone.now()` function to set the current timestamp.
- ### 5. Read-Only Form Fields
- Modify the form classes associated with your CBVs.
- Set the `last_update` and relevant fields as read-only in the form by using attributes like `disabled` or adjusting widget settings.
- This prevents users from editing these fields while still allowing them to view the values.
- ## Conclusion
  By updating your Django app to use Class-Based Views, implementing CRUD functionality, incorporating shared fields, and automating field updates, you'll enhance both the structure and user experience of your application. Ensuring that users can view but not modify critical fields maintains data integrity and accuracy.
